Hello! I'm a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. 

In past internships I have: built a Kahoot clone for RBC internal events, learned about ML at the Social and Intelligent Robotics Research Lab, helped a research team test a new graph database software, and helped automate venue search and negotiations for event planners. Currently, I'm working at 100x, building a platform to reduce the amount of time engineering teams spend on solving production incidents. 

I'm looking for a summer 2025 internship in backend engineering, or product management, please reach out if your team is doing great work: sohil.athare[at]uwaterloo.ca
