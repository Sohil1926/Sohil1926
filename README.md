### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Sohil1926/Sohil1926** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
I'm a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. 

I am currently working on figuring out my next steps in learning how to build great software. Some of the things I did previously include building a Kahoot clone for RBC internal events, learning about ML at the Social and Intelligent Robotics Research Lab, and helping a research team test a new graph database. Currently, I'm interning at a startup that automates event organizing for corporations.

I'm looking for a fall 2024 internship in backend engineering, please do reach out if your team is doing great work: sohil.athare[at]uwaterloo.ca
