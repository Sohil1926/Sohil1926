Hello! I'm a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. 

In past internships I have: built a Kahoot clone for RBC internal events, learned about ML at the Social and Intelligent Robotics Research Lab, and helped a research team test a new graph database software. I was most recently an intern at Nowadays (YC S23) where I helped automate venue search and negotiations for event planners.

I'm looking for a fall 2024 internship in backend engineering, please reach out if your team is doing great work: sohil.athare[at]uwaterloo.ca
